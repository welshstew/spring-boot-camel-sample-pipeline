1. BuildConfig created!

Now please ensure the registry to push to is configured correctly! (see below)

2.  You need to ensure that the certificate for the external registry is configured in the cluster, to do this:

    openssl s_client -connect ${REGISTRY_HOST}:${REGISTRY_PORT} 2>/dev/null </dev/null | Â sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > registry-cert.pem

    oc create configmap registry-cert -n openshift-config \
    --from-file=${REGISTRY_HOST}..${REGISTRY_PORT}=registry-cert.pem

    oc patch image.config.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"additionalTrustedCA":{"name":"registry-cert"}}}' --type=merge

3. You need to ensure the builder account has access to the secret.  Please run:

    oc secrets link builder {{ include "binary-build.fullname" . }}-registry

4.  Now you can actually perform a binary build! e.g.

    oc start-build {{ include "binary-build.fullname" . }} --from-file=http://some-maven-repo/repository/maven-releases/com/codergists/spring-boot-camel/1.0.15/spring-boot-camel-1.0.15.jar
